A GitHub Action that installs the [NetBird](https://netbird.io) client on an Ubuntu runner and joins your network with a
setup key, so the rest of the job can reach your private peers. It can also route the runner's traffic through an exit
node.

## Setup

1. In the NetBird dashboard, open Settings-> **Setup Keys** and create one for your runners:

- **One-off** if a single job uses it, **reusable** otherwise.
- Turn on **Ephemeral**. The action deregisters the peer automatically, but this is a good backstop.
- Set a proper expiry
- Give it a group your access policies already allow, so the runner can reach what it needs.

2. Add the key as a repository secret named `NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY`.

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit the setup key or pass it as a plain string — anyone holding it can register a peer on your network.

## Usage

The only input you need is `setup-key`. Everything else below is optional and shown at its default, apart from
`exit-node` and `dns-hostnames`, which do nothing until you set them:

```yaml
name: Testing

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Connect to the NetBird network
        id: netbird
        uses: ankurk91/netbird-action@v1
        with:
          setup-key: ${{ secrets.NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY }}
          # Point this at your own deployment when you self-host.
          management-url: https://api.netbird.io:443
          # Peer name in the dashboard. Every leg of a matrix shares one run id,
          # so give those a name of their own.
          peer-name: gh-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}
          # Network ID of the route to send traffic through. Off when empty.
          exit-node: ${{ vars.NETBIRD_EXIT_NODE_ID }}
          # Names that must resolve before this step finishes. Off when empty.
          dns-hostnames: ''
          # Only accept addresses inside your network.
          dns-require-private: true
          # Extra flags for the NetBird client.
          args: ''
          # Client release to install. Pin it to keep runs reproducible.
          version: latest
          # How long to wait for the peer, the route and the DNS names.
          timeout: 60
          diagnostics: false

      # From here the runner is a peer and can reach the others.
      - name: Do work on the private network
        run: |
          echo "this runner is ${{ steps.netbird.outputs.netbird-ip }} on the network"
          curl -s http://internal-service.netbird.cloud
```

There is no disconnect step to add — see [Cleanup](#cleanup).

> [!WARNING]
> An exit node carries `0.0.0.0/0`, so the runner's connection to GitHub goes through it too. If the exit node cannot
> reach GitHub, the job hangs after this step rather than failing.

| `exit-node`           | no       | —                            | Network ID to route through. The route must be distributed to this peer's group.             |

| `timeout`             | no       | `60`                         | Seconds to wait for the peer, the exit node route, and the DNS names.                        |
| `diagnostics`         | no       | `false`                      | Print the peer state to the job log. See [Diagnostics](#diagnostics).                        |

## Outputs

| Output       | Description                                                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `netbird-ip` | The runner's IPv4 address inside the NetBird network, e.g. `100.64.0.33`. |

This is the runner's address *inside your network* — what your other peers use to reach it. It is not the runner's
public IP.

## Waiting for DNS

Being connected is not the same as being able to resolve your private hostnames. If the next step in your job reaches a
service *by name*, list those names and the action waits until they work before it hands over:

```yaml
- uses: ankurk91/netbird-action@v1
  with:
    setup-key: ${{ secrets.NETBIRD_SETUP_KEY }}
    dns-hostnames: postgres.netbird.cloud, internal-service.netbird.cloud
```

By default, a name only counts as ready once it points *inside* your network, so a step cannot quietly talk to a public
endpoint when it meant to reach a private one. Set `dns-require-private: false` for a name that is supposed to answer
publicly.

Without this the action still waits for the peer to connect — it just does not check that your names resolve.

## Cleanup

When the job ends the action logs out of NetBird, on a failed job as much as a passing one. The peer leaves your
dashboard and the runner is off your network again, so there is nothing to add to your workflow.

## Requirements

An Ubuntu runner (`ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04`, `ubuntu-26.04`, their `-arm` variants, or self-hosted Ubuntu). The
runner needs passwordless `sudo`, which GitHub-hosted runners have — the client runs as a system service, and the
post-job [cleanup](#cleanup) needs it too.

NetBird client **0.67.0 or newer**.

## Client version

Leave `version` at `latest` for the newest client, or pin it (`0.78.1`) to keep every run identical. The minimum is
**0.67.0**. A client already installed on the runner is kept as it is.

## Diagnostics

`diagnostics: true` prints the peer's state to the job log while you work out why a connection is failing.

It is off by default because that output describes your private network, and job logs reach more people than your
dashboard does. Failures print an anonymised summary either way.
